The original core emulation code written by  neopop_uk  doesn't work on arm cpu,
so I found a modified version for s60 written by  subbie  and used it in version
0.01. The modified version works on e680i,  but unfortunately, there are several
prolems with the S60 version. 1) subbie modified the core code to convert neogeo
pocket color value to s60 color value because all of them are 4096 colors, which
makes some games display with wrong color. 2) exceptions is removed from opcodes
ADD, ADC, SUB & SBC, which makes graphics confused in some games, and raise seg-
mentation fault in some games. 3) the changes of memory read and write  function
cause that some games can't save battery states.

In the second verion 0.02, I have restored most code to original, and keep these
changes made by subbie.  1) speed up in parityB, parityW & DIV_B, DIV_W, DIVS_B,
DIVS_W. (TLCS900h_interpret.c, it isn't important.) 2) byte alignment on 16 & 32
bit read/write. (mem.c, it's very important, otherwise the emulator doesn't work
on e680i.)
